# NetPlumber Reproduction

This repository offers a scripted reproduction of the Internet2 and Stanford
benchmarks for NetPlumber.
It is based on the original repo as offered by Peyman Kazemian with minor
changes to enable reproduction:

Changes include unnecessary inter-rule-dependency calculations (which is later
done by NetPlumber), a missing library for the linker, and a fix for the TF
handling of the Juniper parser.
